# Avocado Price Prediction - Modelling and Visualisations

This repo is a submission for my MSc in Data and Analytics.  The task was to predict the prices of Avocados based on the provided dataset.

## Aims

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the ability to forecast average prices of avocados. The notebook includes:

- Demonstration of data import and inspection
- Data quality checks
- Train/Validate/Test split
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature creation
- Model selection and processing
- Conclusion
- Bibliography

## Plan

The steps involved in the notebook are:

1. **Import and Inspect Data**
2. **Data Quality Checks**
3. **Train/Validate/Test Split**
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
5. **Feature Creation**
6. **Model Selection and Processing**
7. **Conclusion**
8. **Bibliography**

## Installation

To run this notebook, you need to have Python and the following packages installed:

- `pandas`
- `tabulate`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `dash`
- `plotly`
- `ipykernel`
- `prophet`
- `seaborn`
- `xgboost`
- `joblib`

You can install the required packages using the commands in the notebook.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gloverthe/avocado-price-prediction-ml-assignment.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd avocado-price-prediction-ml-assignment
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```sh
jupyter notebook AMV_summative.ipynb
```

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the analysis and model training.

## Data

The data used for this project is stored in a CSV file named `avocado_data.csv`. It includes columns such as:

- `Date`
- `AveragePrice`
- `Total Volume`
- `Type PLU4046`
- `Type PLU4225`
- `Type PLU4770`
- `Total Bags`
- `Small Bags`
- `Large Bags`
- `XLarge Bags`
- `type`
- `year`
- `region`

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide a forecasting model for avocado prices that can help business users plan based on future price predictions.
